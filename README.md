# EpicTestEmployeeFrontEndSample

epic tech test - practical coding challenge : Front-end

Angular 9,8 + Bootstrap + ngForm Validation + basicauth


## Rest API
This Epic Test Employee Front End consumes [Rest API](https://github.com/kapila-silwathge/epicTestEmployeeRestAPISample) running on localhost:8080

## Loging Credentials

 *  user name     : epictest  
  
 *  user password : password
 
 ## Highlights
 
 * Login session is preserved upon page refresh
 
 * Unauthorized access to URIs are redirected to login page
 
 * Bootstrap is used for UI
 
 * Form field validation and validation feedback is displayed to user
 
 * List page is loaded with uptodate data from db ( even after update and add)
 
 * Menu bar is dynamically changed upon login
 
 * Authorization is enforced with an intercepter implementation
  
 * Started this challenge with zero knowledge on Angular :-)
